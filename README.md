# SI28 Presentation

This project is a presentation, we have to do in SI28 (http://www.utc.fr/si28/) at the UTC (http://www.utc.fr).

We have one hour to explain the basics of HTML5, Canvas, JavaScript and jQuery.

We chose to create a mini-game based on Space invaders.

The code is simple and not optimized (just one hour to explain the code!).
